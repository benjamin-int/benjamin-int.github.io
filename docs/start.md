## Applications

* [**ArBade**](arbade.md) → An Environment to record and manage your own voice dataset and later train a model out of it.
* [**Mom**](mom.md) → An Application like [PolyBar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) to manage different workspace, show system status and showing `BaTool` detection output.
* [**Batool**](batool.md) → Engine that use Kaldi model to do online automatic speech recognition with focus on zero delay and maximum accuracy.
* [**ENN**](enn.md) → A Neural Network Engine that trains a redundant model to detect out of vocabulary (OOV) word to overcome conventional FST model limitations.
* [**Rebound**](rebound.md) → An Application that sits between `BaTool` and operating system and act as a virtual input that simulates key strokes and complex command execution based on the focused process.
* **Chess** → Chess devides the screen into small cells that user can choose to select a mouse operation.
